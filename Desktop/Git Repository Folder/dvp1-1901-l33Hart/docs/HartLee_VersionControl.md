This research paper summarizes my time and effort looking into the topic matter outlined below. I have included links and references to research information used for this activity.    

## Topic: Terminal
Professional developers use Terminal daily. It's essential to understand some fundamental commands to use the application. Here's what I have learned...  

**1. Using Terminal, there are essential Linux commands I must know.**

**2. After Trying this in Terminal, I learned...**

**Folder Drop:** That when I drag a folder into the terminal window it gives you the exact location of the file. Exampl is I dragged my Desktop Folder for this class labeled DVP1, and this is the result it gave me; hartmac$ /Users/hartmac/Desktop/DVP1 
 



## Topic: Version Control & Git
Version control, also known as revision control, records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. In this class, we are learning Git. Here's what I have learned. 

**1. There are three types of version control.**

There are three types of Version Control. The most widely use is Local it is where you keep a copy on your drive and simply update the versions as you make your changes. Second is centralized this is where everyone works on the project by accessing the server which the project is held. Third is Distributed this ius where everyone can download the most recent copy of the project and then do their work independently a good example of this is what we are doing right now, with github. 



**2. Using Terminal, there are essential Git commands I must know.**

[ Student Response: List the correct Git commands to do the actions listed below in Terminal. Replace CMD with the correct command and keep or enhance the brief description. **The last bullet provides an example**. 

* git clone [url]: Clone a repository
* git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]”: Set-up a global user name
* git config --global user.email “[valid email]”: Set-up a global email address (to match my GitHub account eMail)
* git status: Show modified files
* git add [file]: Add modified files to the next commit
* git commit -m “[descriptive message]”: Make a commit with a new message
* git log: Show ny commit history
* **Git Help**: This command will bring up Git's help screen in Terminal!
