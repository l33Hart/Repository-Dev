# About This Repository.

This repository will be used to keep track of _Project & Portfolio 1_ research and development conducted during class. This **"About"** folder readme is provided as a quick reference.   


**Important!**: Attend or review the first Lecture or GoTo meeting **BEFORE** you begin to work in your repository. This way you will understand the process and what is required.




## Markdown

Throughout this course, you will be expected to practice using "Markdown" syntax. 

- **Review:** [markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) 

- **Download:** [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) - A markdown text editor
- **Updating Main ReadMe:** You are required to update the main readme file with your own words.

The main readme is located at the top level of this repository, also known as the "root" directory. To help you learn and master markdown syntax, you will update required readme documentation in this course with your own text. 

You will use the main readme to explain your work throughout the month. 

**Make the Best Impression:** Imagine an employer asking to see this work one day. The first thing that employer will see when they visit your repository is the main readme. That is why it is so important to update and refine the text over time. It reflects the amount of time and effort you spent coding, refining, and documenting this repository of work. 

**Note:** You can begin to edit the main readme after attending or watching the first GoTo. It already contains starter text. Your job is to update that text and customize it to reflect your own voice and personality. Be creative with your readme work. Remember, it is a reflection of your ability and professionalism.
